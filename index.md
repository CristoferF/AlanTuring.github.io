can see plenty there that needs to be done.”

	<p style="color: #00FFFF">Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Alan was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to 
study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King’s College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. Alan was Awarded the Smith’s Prize in 1936. The Smith's Prize was the name of each of two prizes awarded annually to two research students in 
mathematics and theoretical physics at the University of Cambridge. However, he was also a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality (which was then considered a crime in the UK). Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere Amendment, "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. 
He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. He died from Cyanide poisoning and was cremated. His ashes were scattered near Working Crematorium. </p> 

<p style="color: #00FFFF">Alan was a part of the OBE (Order of the British Empire) and the FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society). The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is 
a British order of chivalry, rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organizations, and public service outside the Civil service. The Fellowship of the Royal Society is an award granted to individuals that the Royal Society judges 
to have made a "substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge, including mathematics, engineering science and medical science". Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be 
considered a model of a general-purpose computer. A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and 
artificial intelligence. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking center that produced Ultra intelligence. For a while he led Hut 8 which was a section in the Government Code and Cypher School (the British World War II codebreaking station) tasked with 
solving German naval (Kriegsmarine) Enigma messages. The section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis.

<p style="color: #00FFFF">After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory (The NPL is the national measurement standards laboratory 
for the United Kingdom, based at Bushy Park in Teddington, London, England), where he 
designed the ACE (The Automatic Computing Engine was an early electronic stored-program computer), among the first designs for a stored-program computer.

<p style="color: #00FFFF">In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, 
where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. </p>
